# Assignment1
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), in which several vehicles must distribute to a group of clients from a central depot while minimizing the overall journey distance, is solved by this project using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). To evolve better routes across generations, the GA employs tournament selection, ordered crossover, swap mutation, and a population of candidate solutions. Plots demonstrating the algorithm's convergence and visualizations of the final routes for every car are generated by the notebook, which also enables testing of various numbers of clients, vehicles, and GA settings. To execute the project, launch the Assignment1.ipynb notebook in Jupyter, install the necessary libraries (matplotlib and numpy), and then run the cells to view the outcomes.
