# Assignment1
This project solves the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The VRP is a routing problem where several vehicles must serve a group of customers from a central depot while minimizing the total travel distance. The GA is designed with tournament selection, ordered crossover, swap mutation, and a population of candidate solutions that evolve over generations. The notebook produces plots showing how the algorithm converges and visualizations of the final routes for each vehicle. It also includes example datasets for small, medium, and large problems.

To run the project, open the file Assignment1.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook. The notebook already includes the installation commands for the required Python libraries (numpy, matplotlib, and pandas) using %pip install. When you run the first cells of the notebook, these dependencies will be installed automatically if they are not already available. After that, simply run all cells in order to generate the distance matrices, execute the Genetic Algorithm on the provided datasets, view the convergence plots, and display the final vehicle routes.
